## Installation

The Node.js runtime environment is required to run the contents of this application. You can download Node.js here:

After installing Node.js, the application will still require Inquirer.js to run. To set this up, initialize a node package, and then install the appropriate version of Inquirer.js; open a terminal and run the following commands, sequentially...

```
npm init -y

npm install --save inquirer@^8.0.0
```

Code was checked and verified using Jest javascript testing. After completing the steps above, enter the following line of code in your terminal to set up testing capabilities.

npm install --save-dev jest
```
